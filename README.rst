DBuild
======

A MIT-licensed, Makefile-based, KBuild-similar build system for Unix-like
environments, where the key philosophy is user control. It is optimized for
building C/C++ projects, but can probably be beaten into working for other
languages as well.

How to use it
=============

* Copy the contents of the template/ directory to your project.

* Write a root-level DBuild file.

* Work out the project-specific quirks.

An introduction to writing DBuild files
=======================================

TODO: write this. For now, read the source and examples and figure it out.

License
=======

The DBuild build system uses the MIT license, so you can use it in your own
projects without worrying about licensing issues.
